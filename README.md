<kbd>t</kbd>&nbsp;Your dotfiles are how you personalize your system. <i>These are mine.</i>

I was a little tired of having long alias files and everything strewn about (which is extremely common on other dotfiles projects, too). That led to this project being much more topic-centric. I realized, I could split a lot of things up into the main areas I used (CoffeeScript, JavaScript, PERL, Python, PHP, R, Ruby, Sass, git, system libraries, and so on), so I have structured the project accordingly.

If you're interested in the philosophy behind why projects like these are awesome, you might want to read my article on the subject. Post: http://prabhatkumar.org/en/writing/post/2016/10/dotfiles-are-meant-to-be-forked.html

## Topical
Everything's built around topic areas. If you're adding a new area to your forked dotfiles — say, "PERL" — you can simply add a `PERL` directory and put files in there. Afterthat, you can commit directly in to `root` directory of the project.
